## My process

I examined the image supplied by Frontend Mentor and applied my discernment in crafting the design for this social media link profile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

I'm currently utilizing Codecademy to support my coding journey. My notes proved valuable when I encountered difficulties in positioning specific elements within the design.


### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This assisted me in handling positions. I faced some challenges when arranging elements on the page, but referring to articles from W3 Schools has been greatly beneficial.
