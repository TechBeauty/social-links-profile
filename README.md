## My process

I examined the image supplied by Frontend Mentor and applied my discernment in crafting the design for this social media link profile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I discovered that inline styling is useful for swiftly altering the design of a word or sentence, while employing Cascading Style Sheets is particularly beneficial for styling divs or sections within the HTML framework.

Check out some of the code snippets below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<p style="color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%)">Dallas, TX</p> 
  <p style="letter-spacing: 2px;"><small>"Gun Violence Survivor and Speaker."</small></p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css-hover-style {
  background-color:hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```


### Continued development

I'm currently utilizing Codecademy to support my coding journey. My notes proved valuable when I encountered difficulties in positioning specific elements within the design.


### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This assisted me in handling positions. I faced some challenges when arranging elements on the page, but referring to articles from W3 Schools has been greatly beneficial.
